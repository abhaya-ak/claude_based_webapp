## 1. Summary

ScamShield Cloud is a web platform where citizens can **report scams (anonymously if they want)**, **check whether a phone number / link / email / bank account is a known scam before they trust it**, and **learn to spot scams through a simulator**. Cyber-threat analysts turn scattered reports into a verified blacklist and broadcast warnings during scam waves. A cloud admin controls access, tunes the automated risk scanner, and watches system health. It runs on AWS with a highly available design.

## 2. Problem → Solution mapping

| Problem (from brief) | System answer |
|---|---|
| Scams use manipulation, urgency, fake identities | Heuristic scanner flags urgency/coercion patterns; simulator trains users to recognise them |
| Victims under-report (embarrassment, fear, no guidance) | Anonymous-optional report form + instant recovery playbook |
| Scams span email/social/messaging; no central view | One report schema across platforms; indicator clustering; trend dashboard |
| No verified, real-time info for the public | Public lookup with Red/Yellow/Green verdict; SNS alert subscriptions |
| Digital-literacy gap (elderly, teens, non-tech users) | Group-targeted guides (large-font/high-contrast/audio) + "Spot the Scam" simulator |
| Law enforcement can't keep up | Triage workbench, dedup by indicator, threat levels, emergency advisories |

## 3. Objectives and success criteria

| # | Objective | Measurable target (proposed — confirm with team) |
|---|---|---|
| O1 | Fast, safe lookup | p95 lookup API < 300 ms at 100 concurrent users |
| O2 | Easy reporting | Report submission (without upload time) p95 < 1.5 s; ≤ 2 minutes to complete form |
| O3 | High availability | App tier on ≥ 2 AZs behind a load balancer; DB Multi-AZ; target 99.9% |
| O4 | Scalability | Auto Scaling on CPU target 60%; load test 100 concurrent users, 10 min, < 1% errors |
| O5 | Data safety | Evidence private by default; RPO ≤ 5 min (DB point-in-time recovery); RTO ≤ 30 min |
| O6 | Observability | CloudWatch dashboard + alarms for CPU, DB connections, 5xx rate, latency, business metrics |
| O7 | Cost-effective | Documented service choices with cost reasoning; billing alarm set |

## 4. Scope

**In scope:** 4 roles, 8 functionalities (Section 6), React SPA, Django REST API, PostgreSQL on RDS, S3, SNS, Lambda, CloudFront, CloudWatch, ALB + Auto Scaling, containerised deployment.
**Out of scope (state this in the report):** payment recovery/legal action, integration with real police systems, mobile app, ML models (scanner is rule-based), automatic takedown of scam sites, virus scanning of uploads (mitigated by type allow-list + content checks).

## 5. Users and roles

## 7. User journeys

### 7.1 Citizen — report a scam (F1.1)
1. Home → **Report a Scam** → choose *Logged-in tracking* or *Anonymous*.
2. Pick category (Phishing, Fake Job, E-commerce Fraud, Impersonation, Other) and platform (WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook, Email, SMS, Website, Other).
3. Enter scammer identifiers (phone, URL, email, bank account — at least one, max 5), paste message text, optional loss amount + currency + payment method, attach up to 3 screenshots/PDFs.
4. Submit → receive **reference code** (e.g. `SCM-2026-K7Q4M2X9`); anonymous users also receive a **one-time access key** to check status later.
5. Confirmation page shows the **Recovery Playbook** for their incident (e.g. bank-transfer loss → immediate bank-freeze steps + national hotlines).
6. Alternate paths: validation error (field-level messages), file too large/wrong type, rate limit reached (clear message + retry time), duplicate submit (idempotent — same reference returned).

### 7.2 Citizen — lookup & subscribe (F1.2)
1. Paste a number/URL/email/account into the lookup bar on the home page.
2. Verdict card: **Red** (verified scam: report count, category, first/last seen, curated warning note) · **Yellow** (unverified reports/heuristic flag, awaiting analyst) · **Green** (no reports — caution banner: scammers rotate identifiers).
3. Optional: subscribe by email or SMS, choose audience (e.g. Senior-family alerts) and scam categories; confirm via the confirmation message; unsubscribe link in every alert.

### 7.3 Analyst — triage (F2.1)
1. Log in → queue sorted by **risk score** (high first) and **cluster size**.
2. Open a report → split view: left narrative + extracted indicators, right evidence (private S3 via 15-min pre-signed URL).
3. **Verify & Blacklist** (pick which indicator(s)) → indicator promoted to public blacklist; all linked pending reports auto-resolved as Verified; threat level escalated. Or **Reject** (false positive/spam) with reason. Later **Revoke** a wrong blacklist entry.

### 7.4 Analyst — trends & broadcast (F2.2)
1. Dashboard: volume by platform/category over time, losses by region, top manipulation tactics, spike detector (e.g. +300% in 24 h).
2. **Draft Public Threat Advisory** → title, summary, severity, target audience → **Broadcast** → SNS fans out email/SMS to matching subscribers; advisory appears on public advisories page.

### 7.5 Educator — guides & simulator (F3.1, F3.2)
1. Create guide: text/markdown body, target groups (Elderly, Teens, Non-tech, General), language (en/ne/ms), readability mode, tactic tags, attach PDF/audio/image → publish.
2. Build scenario: upload mock screenshot, mark scam/legit, tag tactic (Urgency/Authority/Fear/Greed/None), draw red-flag hotspots with explanations → publish.
3. Citizens browse the Learning Hub filtered by group (elderly view auto-enables large font/high contrast/text-to-speech) and play a 5-scenario challenge → Digital Literacy Score, blind-spot profile, recommended guides.

### 7.6 Admin — access, rules, telemetry (F4.1, F4.2)
1. Review pending analyst/educator registrations (organisation + credentials) → approve/reject.
2. Manage heuristic rules (keywords + weights, suspicious TLDs, shorteners) and thresholds; changes are versioned.
3. Telemetry dashboard (CloudWatch EC2/RDS metrics + custom business metrics) and audit log (rate-limit blocks, role changes, evidence access, rule changes).

## 10. Non-functional requirements

## 13. Assumptions, constraints, risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Lecturer rejects/changes scope | Get approval first; plan is modular (features can be trimmed) |
| AWS Academy/Learner Lab limits (IAM, SES, session expiry) | Check limits in week 1; keep IaC/runbook to rebuild quickly; email-first alerts |
| SNS SMS availability/cost for MY/NP | Email is primary; SMS optional behind a feature flag |
| Cost overrun (NAT, ALB, Multi-AZ RDS) | AWS Budgets alarm; stop/scale down dev resources; documented cost levers |
| Team dependencies (S1 needs S2 models, S3 needs guides) | Contracts frozen early; stub services; parallel plan in backend file |
| Evidence contains victim PII | Private bucket, pre-signed access, audit log, retention policy |
| Plagiarism | Cite sources; paraphrase; acknowledge AI assistance per university rules |
| Marking scheme not yet seen | Obtain from Moodle and map criteria to deliverables |
